; Core version
; ------------
; Each makefile should begin by declaring the core version of Drupal that all
; projects should be compatible with.

core = 7.x

; API version
; ------------
; Every makefile needs to declare it's Drush Make API version. This version of
; drush make uses API version `2`.

api = 2


; If all projects or libraries share common attributes, the `defaults`
; array can be used to specify these globally, rather than
; per-project.

defaults[projects][subdir] = "contrib"

; Core project
; ------------
; In order for your makefile to generate a full Drupal site, you must include
; a core project. This is usually Drupal core, but you can also specify
; alternative core projects like Pressflow. Note that makefiles included with
; install profiles *should not* include a core project.

; Use Pressflow instead of Drupal core:
; projects[pressflow][type] = "core"
; projects[pressflow][download][type] = "file"
; projects[pressflow][download][url] = "http://launchpad.net/pressflow/6.x/6.15.73/+download/pressflow-6.15.73.tar.gz"

; Git clone of Drupal 7.x. Requires the `core` property to be set to 7.x.
; projects[drupal][type] = "core"
; projects[drupal][download][type] = git
; projects[drupal][download][url] = http://git.drupal.org/project/drupal.git

projects[] = drupal

; Projects
; --------
; Each project that you would like to include in the makefile should be
; declared under the `projects` key. The simplest declaration of a project
; looks like this:
